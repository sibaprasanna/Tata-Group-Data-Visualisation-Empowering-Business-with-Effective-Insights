# Tata-Group-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights


The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data.

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme.
♦ Framing the Business Scenario

♦ Choosing the Right Visuals

♦ Creating Effective Visuals

♦ Communicating Insights and Analysis
